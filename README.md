# Weather Application

This cool project is the "SheCodes' plus course project" that I have done successfully.

## Project description:
In this project we aimed to create a weather application that can also show the future days' forecasts.
I used HTML, CSS and JS to implement it.

### Parts of the project:
- Search engin to search the user's desired city
- Search by user's location
- Show current temperature, real feel, wind speed, humidity
- Forecast the future days (min, max temperature + Icons)
- Using Shecode's weather API to update and get the information (in previous versions I used "OpenWeather API")
- Convert weather deegres to celicious and Fahrenhite
